# Implement a scoring model

## Project details
> A financial company wants to develop a scoring model to predict the probability of credit non-payment. This will support the reasoning of accepting or refusing a loan to a potential client, by relying on various data sources (behavioural data, data from other financial institutions...). 

> In addition, CRMs have reported that clients are increasingly demanding transparency. The company therefore decided to **develop an interactive dashboard** so that CRMs could explain credit decisions as **transparently** as possible, but also allow their customers to have access to their personal information and explore it easily.

## Deliverables

-  An interactive dashboard.
-  A folder in github including modelling, dashboard and the deployment source files.
- A methodology note including the learning method, evaluation metrics, cost function, interpretability and limits.
- A support to present the work done and the dashboard.
